### Course Templates
These are the respectively named templates for each course.  The `s3sync.sh` file is a script that syncs this directory with the AWS S3 directory which all course links are using.

This script does require some setup outside of this repo, mainly that AWS cli tools are installed and configured with enough permissions to write to the AWS S3 bucket specified.

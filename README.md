### AWS Cloud Formation Templates

This repository hosts cloud formation templates for use in courses for Wright State University department of Computer Science.

Check the TOOLCHAIN.md file for instructions on getting your system setup for AWS Linux and Windows connections.

SG-Rules.md is just a collection of security group rules (AWS speak for firewall rules) that I have found useful for several courses.
